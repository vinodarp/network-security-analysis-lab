# Network Security Analysis Lab

## 📄 Project Overview
In this lab, I investigated a real-world security scenario where a client reported issues accessing a company's website. The goal was to analyze the root cause of the problem by reviewing network traffic logs using Wireshark.

The analysis revealed signs of a **SYN flood attack**, a type of DoS (Denial of Service) where a web server becomes overwhelmed by a flood of incomplete TCP connection requests, exhausting its resources.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze HTTP and TCP packet logs using Wireshark
- Identify signs of SYN flood behavior
- Understand the three-way handshake in TCP
- Explain how the attack disrupted website availability

---

## 🧠 What I Did
- Interpreted TCP handshake patterns to detect anomalies
- Tracked excessive SYN requests with no corresponding ACKs
- Documented the network behavior and its impact
- Suggested possible mitigations such as SYN cookies or firewalls

---

## 📎 Attached File
- `cybersecurity_incident_report.pdf`: Detailed breakdown of the incident, log analysis, and attack explanation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Packet analysis  
- **Markdown & PDF**: Report documentation  
- **TCP/IP knowledge**: Protocol understanding
